Upgrading from
github.com/360EntSecGroup-Skylar/excelize/v2 v2.3.2
to
github.com/xuri/excelize/v2 v2.6.1
- seems to have given our output files +x permission. This is not good, and is unnecessary.

Upgrading to v2.7.0 seems to have broken things, so I rolled back â€” now back to v2.3.2

- Look into updating to v2.7.0
- Check output file permissions when using v2.7.0


- Writers
 - Should writers throw an error if the given type to write has no tagged fields?


- Logging for CSV and Excel writers on completion, detailing files written?
  - Should be exposed as scrutiny metadata maybe?


- Switch existing reflect stuff in Write to use reflectwalk?
 - Actually, I think this is overkill, we process flat structs.
 - On second thoughts, it may simplify some of our code.


New writer types
----------------

?
