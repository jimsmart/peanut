TODO
====


- Unify the tests:
 - Shared structs
 - Individual constructor/setup for each writer
 - Shared test methods
 - Individual verification methods for each writer
 - Could include checking output file exists / doesn't exist

- Writers currently process all fields. We should ignore those without appropriate tags.
 - I'm pretty sure this has been done, but we should ensure it is covered by a test.


- Write thorough tests for each non-trivial writer.
  - SQLiteWriter
  - ExcelWriter

- Support more types (currently only string and int)


- Writers
 - Should writers throw an error if the given type to write has no tagged fields?
 - Or should they simply fall back to using field names when tags are not present?


- Logging for CSV and Excel writers on completion, detailing files written?
  - Should be exposed as scrutiny metadata maybe?


- Switch existing reflect stuff in Write to use reflectwalk.
 - Actually, I think this is overkill, we process flat structs.
 - On second thoughts, it may simplify some of our code.
