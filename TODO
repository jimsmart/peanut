TODO
====

- Writers currently process all fields. We should ignore those without appropriate tags.



- Writers
 - Should writers throw an error if the given type to write has no tagged fields?
 - Or should they simply fall back to using field names when tags are not present?


- Logging for CSV and Excel writers on completion, detailing files written?
  Should be exposed as scrutiny metadata maybe?


- Switch existing reflect stuff in Write to use a reflect walker.
 - Actually, I think this is overkill, we process flat structs.



New writer types
----------------

SQLiteWriter
- TODO






Done
====

- Metadata reflector should walk structs.
- Metadata reflector should handle more types.
 - Some kind of third-party reflection walker package? - reflectwalk
 
- Idea: structs could have a PrepareMetadata() method, which is called just before metadata is scraped from the struct (to facilitate late computation of metadata values)


JSONStreamWriter - Done, see JSONLWriter.
- See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming
- To futz about with tags/etc, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42546519/how-do-i-dynamically-change-the-structs-json-tag

- Arguably, the metadata stuff doesn't belong in this package? - seperation of concerns, and that.
 - Done: See package scrutiny.
