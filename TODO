- Improve the examples in Godocs.



- Writers
 - Should writers throw an error if the given type to write has no tagged fields?
 - Or should they simply fall back to using field names when tags are not present?


- Logging for CSV and Excel writers on completion, detailing files written?
  - Should be exposed as scrutiny metadata maybe?


- Switch existing reflect stuff in Write to use reflectwalk?
 - Actually, I think this is overkill, we process flat structs.
 - On second thoughts, it may simplify some of our code.



New writer types
