TODO
====


- Writers
 - Should writers throw an error if the given type to write has no tagged fields?


- Logging for CSV and Excel writers on completion, detailing files written?
  - Should be exposed as scrutiny metadata maybe?


- Switch existing reflect stuff in Write to use reflectwalk?
 - Actually, I think this is overkill, we process flat structs.
 - On second thoughts, it may simplify some of our code.


New writer types
----------------

?
